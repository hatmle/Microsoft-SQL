Subqueries	
Self-Contained Subqueries
Can be run in isolation. Subquery is run one time, and returns a result set that can be used in the outer query. 
Database engine presumably evaluates nested SELECT statement(s) first.

   For each of those, we find matching values in P2.categoryid, then find the
   one MIN(unitprice) value of that set, which the subquery returns to the 
   outer query. The outer query filters for P1.unitprice values, and adds them
   to an intermediate result set, then passes in the next P1.categoryid value
   to the subquery. When all P1.categoryid values have been processed, the
   outer query returns the final compiled (and possibly sorted) result set.

   Since all the filtering for the example happens in the subquery, the outer
